- max line length should be 100, 80 is better (pep8).
- functions:
   - keep the number of positional arguments as low as possible
   - use keyword arguments
    ```python
    def function(*, argument=None):
         if argument is None:
              argument = default_value
         ...
    ```
    or
    ```python
    def function(*, **kwargs):
         argument = kwargs.pop('argument_key', default_value)
         ...
    ```
